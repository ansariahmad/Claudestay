**Claudestay** is an intelligent hotel information assistant powered by the **Claude Opus 3** Large Language Model (LLM). It allows users to ask natural language queries about hotels worldwide and receive accurate, contextual answers along with audio playback. The system combines **web scraping**, **vector databases**, **retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)**, and a **Streamlit interface** to create a smooth and interactive user experience.
